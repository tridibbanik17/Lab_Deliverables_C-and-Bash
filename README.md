## About The Project

### Author: Tridib Banik, McMaster University, Software Engineering Level II.

This repository contains the lab deliverables for SFWRENG 2XC3: Development Basics, a course at McMaster University instructed by Dr. Sam Scott. The labs cover fundamental concepts in C programming and Bash scripting. The deliverables are organized by week, with each week focusing on a specific set of skills and concepts.

### Key Features

- **C Programming Exercises:** Includes exercises on C syntax, program structure, arrays, pointers, string processing, and linked lists.
- **Bash Scripting Exercises:** Includes exercises on Bash scripting, regular expressions, and Linux commands.
- **Makefile Usage:** Demonstrates the use of Makefiles for compiling C programs.
- **Code Coverage:** Demonstrates the use of `gcov` for code coverage analysis.
- **Program Optimization:** Explores techniques for program optimization, such as removing function calls and algorithmic optimization.

## Architecture

The repository is structured into weekly lab directories, each containing C source files, Bash scripts, Makefiles, and text files.

- **C Source Files:** Implement various algorithms and data structures.
- **Bash Scripts:** Automate tasks, manipulate text, and perform system operations.
- **Makefiles:** Simplify the compilation process for C programs.
- **Text Files:** Contain data, instructions, or results for the exercises.

### Weekly Breakdown

- **Week 1:** Bash script for directory navigation and cleanup, basic C programs, and a Makefile.
- **Week 2:** Command-line interactive quiz program and argument processing in C.
- **Week 3:** Standard input/output handling in C, Linux pipes, and text processing.
- **Week 4:** Bash scripts using regular expressions and basic regex exercises.
- **Week 5:** C exercises on loops, date handling, and structured output formatting.
- **Week 6:** C program structure, pointers, function prototypes, recursion, and code coverage.
- **Week 7:** Array and pointer manipulation in C, including searching and counting occurrences.
- **Week 9:** Preprocessor outputs, performance measurement, and optimization techniques.
- **Week 10:** String processing in C, including case conversion and trimming.
- **Week 11:** Linked list operations such as counting, appending, and reversing lists.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need a Linux environment with the following tools installed:

### Prerequisites

- **GCC:** The GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C programs.
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install gcc
  ```
- **Make:** A build automation tool.
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install make
  ```
- **Bash:** The Bourne Again Shell. Usually pre-installed on Linux systems.
- **Gcov:** A code coverage analysis tool (optional, for week 6).
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install gcovr
  ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tridibbanik17/lab_deliverables_c-and-bash.git
   ```
2.  Navigate to the desired week's directory:
   ```sh
   cd tridibbanik17-lab_deliverables_c-and-bash/2XC3-labs/week1
   ```
3.  Compile and run the C programs using Make (if applicable):
   ```sh
   make
   ./program_name
   ```
4.  Execute Bash scripts:
   ```sh
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ./script_name.sh
   ```
