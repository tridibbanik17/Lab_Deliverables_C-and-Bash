### This repository contains all the lab deliverables from the SFWRENG 2XC3: Development Basics course instructed by Dr. Sam Scott. 

### Week1 folder contains a Bash script to navigate to the target directory, remove all files with the .tmp file extension and return to the previous directory, two C files such as printing out to standard output and a makefile to compile C files.

### Week2 folder contains two C files such as a C program that knows at least three quiz questions and answers and users interact with the program through command line flags, and a C program that reads the command line and prints out the last argument input by the user.

### Week3 folder contains C exercises on stdout and stdin in C such as reading strings one at a time from stdin and writing them to stdout (one string per line). The folder also contains Bash scripts and text files with Linux commands on Linux pipes and filters.

### Week4 folder contains 3 Bash scripts that use Bash regular expressions to split words delimited by whitespace from stdin, and doubling integers from the stdin entered one at a time and 2 text files with some basic regex exercise solutions.

### Week5 folder contains 3 C exercises on the syntactic structures in C such as using a for loop to print a nicely formatted calendar to standard out, using a do-while loop to get dates from the user, and using a switch statement to output the date (input by the user) with the name of the month.

### Week6 folder contains 4 C exercises on C program structures such as function prototypes with pointers, refactoring (small transformations to restructure code without changing any program behaviour) and its implementation, and code coverage (using gcov). The folder also contains a C exercise on recursion (using a base case and a recursive case to compute a hailstone sequence).

### Week7 folder contains four C exercises on arrays and pointers in C such as searching for an item (key) in an array by index, searching for an item (key) in an array by pointer, counting the number of occurrences of an item (key) in an array, and counting the number of occurrences of an item (key) in a 2D array.

### Week9 folder contains four C exercises on preprocessor outputs, measuring performance, program optimization by removing function calls, and optimization algorithmically.

### Week10 folder contains four C exercises on string processing such as converting a string to upper case, conversion to lower case with no side effects, and trimming trailing whitespace.

### Week11 folder contains three C exercises on linked lists such as counting items in a list, appending a new node to the end of a list, and reversing a list.
