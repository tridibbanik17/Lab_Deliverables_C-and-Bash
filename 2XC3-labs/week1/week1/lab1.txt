What are the top 3 things you’ve learned?
--> The three things I have learned so far are the continuous integration involved in DevOps, how to use vim editor to create and edit a text file from Linux Shell and finally how to download the Windows Subsystem of Linux (wsl) to my Windows OS and use it to learn Bash scripting without even buying a Linux machine.
                                                                                                                        What are you excited to learn more about?                                                                               --> I am excited to learn more about new Linux commands to execute powerful executive tasks and also automate various systems as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        What are you worried about in the course?
--> I am worried about the labs in the course. Every week there is only one lecture and two labs. I am afraid that I will forget to complete pre-lab tasks due to midterms and commitment to other courses. And if I don't prepare for the labs in advance, I might take longer than others to complete the lab activities during the lab period and so I might fall behind.
